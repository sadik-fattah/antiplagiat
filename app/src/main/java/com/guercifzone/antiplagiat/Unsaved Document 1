Here are some free APIs that you can use to detect if a text is AI-generated. Please note that while many of these services offer free tiers, they often come with limitations (like rate limits or usage caps). You should check the documentation of each API for more details on how to integrate and any restrictions.

### 1. **OpenAI GPT-3/4 Detection (via OpenAI API)**
   OpenAI offers an API to interact with GPT-3 or GPT-4 models, and you can potentially use it to detect if a text was generated by their models. OpenAI's API isn't strictly a "AI text detector," but with the GPT-3/4 models, you could infer if the text exhibits patterns of AI generation.
   
   - **Website:** [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/)
   - **Free tier:** OpenAI provides free API credits for new users.
   - **Example Base URL:**
     ```java
     baseUrl("https://api.openai.com/v1/")
     ```
   - **Documentation:** [OpenAI API Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs)

   **Important:** OpenAI doesn’t directly offer a "detection" API, but using the OpenAI API’s completions and embeddings endpoints can allow you to analyze the likelihood of a text being AI-generated based on its stylistic markers.

### 2. **Hugging Face Model API (for Text Classification)**
   Hugging Face offers many pre-trained models that can be used for text classification, including detecting AI-generated text. They have free APIs for certain models, which can classify text as AI-generated or human-written. You can use models like `roberta-large-mnli` for this task.

   - **Website:** [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
   - **Free tier:** Hugging Face provides a free tier with some limited requests.
   - **Example Base URL:**
     ```java
     baseUrl("https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/")
     ```
   - **Documentation:** [Hugging Face API Docs](https://huggingface.co/docs)

   **Example Models:**
   - `text-classification` models (like GPT-2 or GPT-3 classifiers) can help in detecting AI-generated text.

### 3. **AI Text Classifier by OpenAI (free for limited usage)**
   OpenAI provides a more specific API for detecting if text is AI-generated. The AI Text Classifier can identify whether the text was written by a human or AI, especially based on OpenAI models like GPT.

   - **Website:** [AI Text Classifier by OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
   - **Free tier:** OpenAI has a free tier with limited usage.
   - **Example Base URL:**
     ```java
     baseUrl("https://api.openai.com/v1/classifications/")
     ```
   - **Documentation:** [OpenAI API Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs)

### 4. **TextRazor API (Free Plan Available)**
   TextRazor is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) API that can perform a wide range of tasks, including detecting entities, topics, and more. While it does not directly provide AI-text detection, it can classify and analyze the text, which could be used in conjunction with other methods to detect AI-generated content.

   - **Website:** [TextRazor API](https://www.textrazor.com/)
   - **Free tier:** 500 requests per day (for free users).
   - **Example Base URL:**
     ```java
     baseUrl("https://api.textrazor.com/")
     ```
   - **Documentation:** [TextRazor API Docs](https://www.textrazor.com/docs)

### 5. **Twinword Text Analysis API (Free Plan Available)**
   Twinword provides a text analysis API, including sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and language classification, which could be leveraged to infer whether a text might be AI-generated. While it doesn’t directly claim to detect AI-generated text, its features allow for deep linguistic analysis.

   - **Website:** [Twinword API](https://www.twinword.com/)
   - **Free tier:** 500 requests per month for free users.
   - **Example Base URL:**
     ```java
     baseUrl("https://api.twinword.com/")
     ```
   - **Documentation:** [Twinword API Docs](https://www.twinword.com/api/)

### 6. **AI21 Labs Studio (Free Plan Available)**
   AI21 Labs offers a suite of language models similar to OpenAI's GPT models. You can use their API to generate or analyze text, and infer if the text is AI-generated. AI21 Labs may offer useful tools for detecting AI text if you understand its structure and language patterns.

   - **Website:** [AI21 Labs API](https://www.ai21.com/)
   - **Free tier:** 5,000 tokens/month (for free users).
   - **Example Base URL:**
     ```java
     baseUrl("https://api.ai21.com/v1/")
     ```
   - **Documentation:** [AI21 Labs API Docs](https://docs.ai21.com/)

### 7. **FakeFinder API (AI Content Detection)**
   FakeFinder is a specialized tool for detecting AI-generated content, and it focuses on identifying if a piece of text was created by a language model like GPT-3.

   - **Website:** [FakeFinder API](https://www.fakefinder.ai/)
   - **Free tier:** A free trial is available with limited requests.
   - **Example Base URL:**
     ```java
     baseUrl("https://api.fakefinder.ai/")
     ```
   - **Documentation:** [FakeFinder API Docs](https://www.fakefinder.ai/docs)

### Integrating One of These APIs in Your App

Once you choose a suitable API, you can integrate it in your Android app using Retrofit or any HTTP client. Here's how you can structure it using Retrofit:

1. **Define the Retrofit Interface:**

```java
public interface AiTextDetectionApi {
    @POST("detect-ai")
    Call<DetectionResponse> detectAiText(@Body String text);
}
```

2. **Set up the Retrofit Client:**

```java
Retrofit retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder()
        .baseUrl("https://api.example.com/")  // Replace with the actual API base URL
        .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
        .build();

AiTextDetectionApi api = retrofit.create(AiTextDetectionApi.class);
```

3. **Make the API Call:**

```java
Call<DetectionResponse> call = api.detectAiText(inputText);
call.enqueue(new Callback<DetectionResponse>() {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(Call<DetectionResponse> call, Response<DetectionResponse> response) {
        if (response.isSuccessful()) {
            boolean isAiGenerated = response.body().isAiGenerated();
            // Handle the result (update UI)
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Call<DetectionResponse> call, Throwable t) {
        // Handle failure
    }
});
```

### Conclusion

The APIs mentioned above provide free tiers, but their limits may vary. Be sure to explore each one and determine the best fit based on your specific use case and the text generation detection capabilities. You can use the provided base URLs and documentation to get started with integrating them into your Android app.
